        <h2>My Mentorship Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that mentorship is one of the most important aspects of scientific research. As someone who has benefited tremendously from the guidance of incredible mentors throughout my journey, I am passionate about paying it forward and supporting the next generation of astronomers, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach to mentorship emphasizes <strong>inclusive guidance</strong>, <strong>hands-on learning</strong>, and <strong>fostering independence</strong>. I strive to create an environment where students feel supported to take risks, ask questions, and develop their own scientific voice.
